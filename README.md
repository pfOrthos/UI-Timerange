This user interface allows users to allocate shifts by selecting a specific time range, which is visually represented as 
a yellow wedge on the globe. By dragging this wedge, users can adjust the start and end times of the shift. The background 
of the interface dynamically changes based on the time of day, providing clearer visual cues. During the evening and night 
hours, the moon is displayed, while the sun appears in the morning and daytime. This intuitive visual aid enhances the 
user's ability to manage and understand time-based activities more effectively.
